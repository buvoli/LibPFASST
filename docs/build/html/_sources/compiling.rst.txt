Compiling
=========

LibPFASST comes with its own Makefiles, and it is possible that simply typing 'make' in the directory /LibPFASST will compile the code succesfully.  A successful make will build the file

LibPFASST/lib/libpfasst.a  

Before compiling, you will need an MPI library installed.  On Debian
or Ubuntu machines, we recommend MPICH2:

  `$ sudo apt-get install mpich2 libmpich2-dev`

You may also need to install open-blas

  `$ sudo apt-get install  libopenblas-dev`


The user may have to change the compiler and compiler flags defined in Makefile.local and
'Makefile.defaults'.

The first three flags correspond to the compilers and linkers.  These can be changed to correspond to those used on your system.

FC = mpiffort 
CC = mpicc
LD= $(FC)
AR = ar rcs

Some optional flags are

DEBUG = FALSE

which if made true will add many diagnostic flags to the build, and

MKVERBOSE=FALSE

which if made true will show more info in the build steps.  These can also both be changed on the command line as in

 make MKVERBOSE=TRUE DEBUG=TRUE

There is a Fortran dependency file included called .depend.  If you want to remake this, it can be done using the makedpef90 package by uncommenting out the appropriate lines in Makefile.rules and typing

make depend

Finally, one can type

make clean

to remove all intermediate files and start from scratch.
